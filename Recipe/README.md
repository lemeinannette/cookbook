  # Introduction
This project presents a detailed recipe for Grandma's Secret Apple Pie, cherished for its flavor and simplicity. The recipe has been refined over the years and guarantees a perfect apple pie every time.

 # Ingredients
Prepare the following ingredients to make Grandma's Secret Apple Pie:

1/2 cup sugar
2 tbsp ground cinnamon
6 medium-sized apples, peeled and sliced
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 package of refrigerated pie crusts (or homemade pie crust)
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
1 tbsp milk (for egg wash)
 # Procedure
Follow these steps to bake Grandma's Secret Apple Pie:

Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, lemon juice, flour, and salt. Toss to coat the apples evenly.
Roll out one of the pie crusts and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish, letting the excess dough hang over the edges.
Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly.
Dot the top of the apple mixture with small pieces of butter.
Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the apples. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal.
Cut several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
In a small bowl, beat the egg and milk together to make the egg wash. Brush the top crust with the egg wash.
Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
If the edges of the crust start to brown too quickly, cover them with strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning.
Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving. This allows the filling to set properly.
Enjoy a slice of Grandma's Secret Apple Pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream!
